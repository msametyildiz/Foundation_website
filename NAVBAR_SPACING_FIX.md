# Navbar Spacing Fix - Hakkımızda Page

## Problem
The "Hakkımızda" heading text on the About page was positioned too close to the fixed navbar, causing poor user experience and readability issues.

## Root Cause
The fixed navbar has a height of 80px (70px on mobile), but the `.hero-section` class used on About and Donate pages didn't account for this fixed positioning, causing content to be partially hidden behind the navbar.

## Solution
Added proper top padding to the `.hero-section` class to create adequate spacing:

```css
.hero-section {
    padding-top: calc(80px + var(--spacing-3xl)); /* Navbar height + spacing */
    padding-bottom: var(--spacing-3xl);
    min-height: 60vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--gray-50) 0%, var(--white) 100%);
    position: relative;
}
```

## Mobile Responsive Fix
For mobile devices, the navbar height is 70px, so the responsive CSS was updated:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .hero-section {
        padding-top: calc(70px + var(--spacing-2xl)); /* Mobile navbar height + spacing */
        min-height: 50vh;
    }
}
```

## Additional Improvements
- Added subtle background gradient for better visual appeal
- Enhanced typography styling for hero section headings and content
- Ensured proper z-index positioning

## Pages Affected
- About page (`/index.php?page=about`)
- Donate page (`/index.php?page=donate`)
