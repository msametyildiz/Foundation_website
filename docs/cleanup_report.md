## Removed Code Fragments

### Commented-Out Code
No substantial blocks of commented-out code were found that needed removal. Most comments were documentation or explanatory notes.

### Unused Functions and Components
- Removed duplicate `enhancedSmoothScroll()` function in main.js
- Removed duplicate `initializeParallaxEffects()` function in main.js
- Removed duplicate `initializeFloatingCards()` function in main.js

### Redundant Code
- Removed console.log debugging statement from logo-base64.js

## Performance Optimizations

### Removed Debug Statements
- Removed `console.log('Base64 logo loaded successfully');` from logo-base64.js

### Style and Script Optimizations
- Eliminated redundant library files by removing duplicates from assets/js that already exist in assets/vendor
- Removed duplicate JavaScript function definitions in main.js

## Before/After Summary

### Key Metrics
- Deleted 17 unnecessary files
- Removed 52 lines of redundant code from main.js (1113 â†’ 1061 lines)
- Eliminated 3 duplicate function definitions
- Removed 164 KB of redundant JavaScript libraries (bootstrap.bundle.min.js + jquery.min.js)
- Overall file size reduction of approximately 290 KB

### Observations
- The codebase contained numerous test and debugging files that were no longer needed for production
- There were duplicate JavaScript library files that added unnecessary weight to the codebase
- Several empty or incomplete documentation files were found and removed
- The main JavaScript file (main.js) contained duplicate function definitions that could lead to unexpected behavior
- Overall, the cleanup has resulted in a more streamlined and maintainable codebase without affecting functionality
